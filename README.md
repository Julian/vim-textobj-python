# vim-textobj-python

This is a Vim plugin to provide text objects for Python functions and classes.  It provides the following objects:

- `af`: a function
- `if`: inner function
- `ac`: a class
- `ic`: inner class

It requires kana's [vim-textobj-user](https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user). I recommend installing both `vim-textobj-user` and `vim-textobj-python` with [pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).
